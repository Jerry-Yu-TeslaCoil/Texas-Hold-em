/**
 * Context class serving the game state, providing necessary info.
 *
 * <p>
 *     This is only used for game states.
 *     It provides the player list of the game, which includes other necessary information.
 *     For example, player's stack in hand, hole cards, button position, etc.
 *     To keep isolation, context should not provide exact iterator of the list.
 *     It also provides a pot manager for stack settlement.
 * </p>
 *

 *     This is an info-class.
